                Gamewaver reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice to you to make changes to this
                agreement if it is needed. So if you want to keep in touch with the new changes it's up to you to

                where Gamewaver is hosted or International law. Doing so may lead to you being immediately and
                permanently banned. Therefore we do keep a record of every user IP address to help enforce these
                conditions. With all that said we value your opinion and freedom of speech and we will never try to

                comments we as a company can not be held responsible for what our users post and do on our website and
                the consequences of their actions. We are also not your parents so we cannot resolve any issues that
                occurred on the website between other users and you, so any request for that is prohibited and will be
                punished.
